# LiveClip
 A real-time collaborative text editor, which is essentially a textpad that syncs across multiple connected devices.
 Users can join a room by simply scanning the QR code on the page, or by going to the page's URL. Yeah, it's as simple as that.
 Also, different versions of the text can be saved and restored at any later period of time. These versions will also be synced across all the connected users.
 The frontend is built without any frameworks, while the backend is based on Socket.IO library on top of NodeJS.
 Give it a shot via the link below and I'm sure you'll have a great experience using it. The UI uses Neomorphism which gives the whole editor a very classy and smooth finish which is a pleasant to the eye unlike other boring text-editors.
