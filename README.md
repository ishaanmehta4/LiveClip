 Socket.IO
 Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
 A real-time collaborative text editor, which is essentially a textpad that syncs across multiple connected devices.
 Users can join a room by scanning the QR code on the page, or by going to the page's URL.
 Also, different versions of the text can be saved and restored at a later time, these versions are also synced across all the connected users.
 The frontend is built without any frameworks, while the backend uses Socket.IO library on top of NodeJS.
